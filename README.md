OpenCV (Computer Vision) experiments in Python

** Experiments in Computer Vision, using OpenCV in Python **
Through various projects that invariably had hardware embodiment, I have experimented with and generated OpenCV code in Python.

These experiments explore OpenCV for:
01. Video Capture (Black and White)
02. Video Capture (Coloured)
03. Aruco Markers (Custom Fiducials like QR Code Patterns)
04. Match Template
05. Draw Command
06. Raspberry Pi to Arduino Serial Connection
07. Face Detection and Tracking
08. Edge Detection
09. Human Silhouette Detection
